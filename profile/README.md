# Welcome to Edualgo Academy üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Edualgo Academy** is a small startup, focused on building learner centric, research based education curriculum. Complexities are everywhere, 
but only a good teacher can simplify those complexities and make them learner specific. We try to provide quality content, mentorship and related 
resources at a cheaper price. Quality is taken quite seriously at our place.

Edualgo Academy was started with an opensource project named as ["Edualgo"](https://pypi.org/project/eduAlgo/), which is a python library published with PyPI (`pip install edualgo`). Since it's initiation we are creating, promoting and supporting opensource at each step of our development. This organization profile is a free and open source project landing page containing a lot of beginner, intermediate and advanced opensource projects to contribute, which is developed by the developers of Edualgo Academy.
