## Welcome 👋


🙋‍♀️ **Edualgo Academy** is a small startup, focused on building learner centric, research based education curriculum. Complexities are everywhere, 
but only a good teacher can simplify those complexities and make them learner specific. We try to provide quality content, mentorship and related 
resources at a cheaper price. Quality is taken quite seriously at our place.

🌈 We strongly support **opensource**, feel free to check our repositories.
